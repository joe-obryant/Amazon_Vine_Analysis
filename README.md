# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to examine amazon seller date for any hint of success or usefullness of the Amazon Vine Program.

## Results
- There were a total of 285 Vine program reviews compared to 31,545 reviews from non Vine members
- Vine paid reviews had 157 5 star reviews while non Vine had 14,144 5 star reviews
- Overall the percentage of 5 star reviews for Vine subscribers was 55% while non Vine's percentage of 5 star reviews was only 45%.

## Summary
Ultimately it is hard to state whether or not there is an positivity bias between Vine reviews and non Vine reviews. While Vine reviews had nearly 10% more 5 star reviews, the difference in sample sizes makes it harder to come to any bias conclusion. Rather than just looking at 5 star reviews, another test could be done while looking at each star rating to better break up the difference in sample sizes and get a more in depth look at the data.
